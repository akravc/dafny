The `{:rlimit N}` attribute, which multiplied `N` by 1000 before sending it to Z3, is deprecated in favor of the `{:resource_limit N}` attribute, which can accept string arguments with exponential notation for brevity. The `--resource-limit` flag also now omits the multiplication and allows exponential notation.
